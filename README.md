*   **Content Management:** Add, modify, delete, and list players, teams, nationalities, and other related entities.
*   **Team Management:** Create and manage teams, including assigning and unassigning players.
*   **Internationalization:** Supports multiple languages, allowing users to switch the interface language (currently French and English).
